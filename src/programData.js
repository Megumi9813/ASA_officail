Many who don’t speak English fluently face a number of obstacles in Canada such as preparing for career changes, learning about Canadian college or simply trying to keep up with their children’s progress in English. Here at ASA, we offer the English for English Program for Immigrants in Canada (EPIC) that is tailor-made for new immigrants who may be considering career changes or simply looking to improve their English as they adapt to the Canadian lifestyle. While many standard ESL programs assume a foundation in English abilities, EPIC recognizes that not all English students have an expansive background in formal English education. We focus on building foundational and intermediate skills by providing students with functional tasks and skills to address weaknesses in their use of everyday English.",
